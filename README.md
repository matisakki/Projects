# C-projekti
This was project in C-programming course.
C-projekti is a simple game that we needed to create. You can attack other characters and calculate experience points. There is option for storing and pulling data from .txt file. Project could be divided to different files so it would be easier to read, but i was in hurry when i made this :D.
